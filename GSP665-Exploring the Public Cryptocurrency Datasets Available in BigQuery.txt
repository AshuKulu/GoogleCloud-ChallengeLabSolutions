##Task 3:

-- SQL source from https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/introducing-six-new-cryptocurrencies-in-bigquery-public-datasets-and-how-to-analyze-them
WITH double_entry_book AS (
   -- debits
   SELECT
    array_to_string(inputs.addresses, ",") as address
   , inputs.type
   , -inputs.value as value
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.crypto_dogecoin.inputs` as inputs
   UNION ALL
   -- credits
   SELECT
    array_to_string(outputs.addresses, ",") as address
   , outputs.type
   , outputs.value as value
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.crypto_dogecoin.outputs` as outputs
)
SELECT
   address
,   type   
,   sum(value) as balance
FROM double_entry_book
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY balance DESC
LIMIT 100

##Task 5:
-->  1st Query
  
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE lab.51 (transaction_hash STRING) as 
SELECT transaction_id FROM `bigquery-public-data.bitcoin_blockchain.transactions` , UNNEST( outputs ) as outputs
where outputs.output_satoshis = 19499300000000

-->  2nd Query
  
-- SQL source from https://cloud.google.com/blog/product...
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE lab.52 (balance NUMERIC) as
WITH double_entry_book AS (
   -- debits
   SELECT
    array_to_string(inputs.addresses, ",") as address
   , -inputs.value as value
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.crypto_bitcoin.inputs` as inputs
   UNION ALL
   -- credits
   SELECT
    array_to_string(outputs.addresses, ",") as address
   , outputs.value as value
   FROM `bigquery-public-data.crypto_bitcoin.outputs` as outputs
)
SELECT   
sum(value) as balance
FROM double_entry_book
where address = "1XPTgDRhN8RFnzniWCddobD9iKZatrvH4"

Finished!!! Congratulations
